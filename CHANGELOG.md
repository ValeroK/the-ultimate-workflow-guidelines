# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- `.github/workflows/validate.yml` — PR-time JSON-syntax check on all three manifests and a version-consistency assertion across the four version slots.

### Fixed
- Reconciled drift between `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`: identical `description` and `keywords` everywhere, and `homepage` + `repository` now present in the Claude manifest (previously only in the Cursor one).

### Changed
- `memory.md` placeholder comment collapsed from a six-line example block to a one-line pointer to the entry-shape template.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added
- `memory.md` slim-index + lazy topical-file pattern, with template under `skills/the-ultimate-workflow-guidelines/references/memory-template.md`. Topical knowledge ("how X works", "why we picked Y") lives in `memory/<topic>.md` and is read on demand when the task touches the topic. Defensive one-liners ("beware X") still go to `CLAUDE.md` `## Gotchas`.
- Dual Claude + Cursor plugin ZIP as a release asset (`the-ultimate-workflow-guidelines-plugin.zip`) — same archive installs into both ecosystems.

### Changed
- `README.md` and the project-explainer copy rewritten to cover the slim-index + lazy-load memory pattern and clarify the Gotchas vs Memory distinction.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- `LICENSE` file (MIT-with-Attribution) and `.gitignore`.
- Claude Desktop install path via release ZIPs.

### Changed
- Switched license declaration to MIT-with-Attribution (`LicenseRef-MIT-Attribution`) across `plugin.json` and SKILL.md frontmatter.

### Removed
- Unreferenced `EXAMPLES.md`.

## [2.1.1] - earlier

### Removed
- Multica promo and X link from README header.

## [2.1.0] - earlier

### Added
- Initial dual-ecosystem layout (Cursor rules under `rules/`, Agent Skills under `skills/`).
- README and `CURSOR.md` install instructions for both ecosystems.

### Changed
- Rebranded to `the-ultimate-workflow-guidelines`.
- Added the explicit Workflow section (plan-first, test-first, blocker protocol) and the sibling `project-bootstrap-guidelines` skill.
